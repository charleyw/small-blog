        .mark Interests
        %p Specific areas of my professional interest include:                    
        %b Java
        &ndash; in java my favorite feature is its (<i>unlimited</i>) power and simplicity. Other attractive features for me is:
        %ul         
          %li Java (and JVM) itself as language
          %li Parallel programming
          %li Dependency injection containers (Google Guice, Tapestry IoC). I have experience in building my own, custom IoC container based on annotations
          %li Dynamic languages built on top of the JVM (Groovy, JRuby)
          %li Web-frameworks: Tapestry 5, custom made frameworks
      
        %b Ruby 
        &ndash; the main feature of ruby that attracts me is its outstanding flexibility and code expressiveness (though its inherent for the most dynamic languages). Ruby-linked technologies that attract me are:
        %ul        
          %li 
            Lightweight web-framework Sinatra (This site is powered by Sinatra, 
            %a{ :href => "/" } Read more...
            )
          %li Haml+Sass template engine, I like that simple concepts that lay in base of this technologies, maybe if I ever overcome my laziness I will port this beautiful technology to Java.

        %b C++
        &ndash; I like this old and fundamental language. I've closely worked with this language for 1.5 years - I've participated in development of enterprise 3D CAD system it was really intresting and challenging work. I've closely worked with OpenGL, STL and Boost.
        %ul
          %li I've worked for 1.5 years with C++ building 3D CAD application
